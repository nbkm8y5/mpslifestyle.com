Using Agile Methodology

## 1. User Stories - representing new functionality
	

	Add storefront, possibly from scripting that exists in webhost.
	Database for comment log and PHP code
    Tablet and mobile responsive site
    Upload videos to youtube.
    Take more pictures at the basketball camp
    Create database in Go Daddy web host.
    Is Instagram set up?
	
## 2. Bugs – representing work to address a defect

## 3. Chores – representing work that must be done, but provide no direct business value

    Correct usage of id elements on several items, change them to a single class.
    Convert files to php and asjust all links accordingly.

## 4. Epics – representing big user stories. Originally defined as too big to fit in an iteration (the equivalent of a Scrum sprint)

## 5. Prototypes (a form of risk mitigation) – representing proof of concepts that help provide information for decision making around whether some functionality may be valuable
